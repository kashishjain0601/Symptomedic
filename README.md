# Symptomedic

Imagine facing a health issue and feeling overwhelmed by the high costs of consulting doctors or the anxiety of searching symptoms online, where results often lead to unnecessary panic. Many people encounter these challenges daily, unsure where to turn for reliable medical guidance without breaking the bank or risking misinformation.

To address this, our project introduces a solution: a free, sensible healthcare chatbot. This bot is designed to provide accurate medical advice in a clear and reassuring manner, offering a reliable alternative to expensive consultations and unreliable online searches. It aims to empower users with the information they need to make informed health decisions confidently and affordably.
